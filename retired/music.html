	<p class="title">Sketchrock (2009)</p>
	
	<p>A collection of tracks created in the period 2007 - early 2010. Home recordings &amp;/or recorded at gigs - mainly at the sadly missed Don't Look Gallery in Dulwich Hill, Sydney.<br/>

	The majority of these works were composed by processing audio recordings in Max/MSP on a laptop. They were performed in the same manner with the addition of some kind of real-time intervention, using a MIDI controller or Kaoss pad.</p>
	
	<p>Listen to the collection on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/catfingers/sets/public-tracks/">Soundcloud</a></p>
	
	<!-- <p class="title">mfv</p>
	
	<p>started in about 2000 &amp; eventually finished in 2007. Included in the <a href="http://soundlab.newmediafest.org/blog/?page_id=185" target="_blank" class="inline">SoundLab VI</a> online exhibition of sound art.

	This work was inspired by the notion of enlarging a tiny fragment of audio into the size of a larger piece of music by employing digital analysis and synthesis software. The final sung notes &amp; chord from a recording made by my father late in his life is used as the source. </p>

	<p class="title">souvenir (1996)</p>
	
	<p>A remix of <b>journey that keeps at a distance</b> - a composition for tenor sax &amp; electronics (Sax played by Greg Telian). That was over in a flash at Artspace in Sydney in 1995 (during one of the 'Sounds in Space' programmes.

	I re-worked the recordings of the performance into this composition the following year For me this one of the first things I ever completed using a computer for editing &amp; mixing, as opposed to a radio workshop or tape-based home studio. 
	
	It was included in a concert of computer &amp; tape works organised bt WATT at Newtown Performing Arts hall 1999.
	
	I revisited this piece - manipulated off a CD turntable - in January 2010 in a short collaboration with Alex Spence (Clarinets) at the Difficult Music Festival at Sedition in Darlinghurst, Sydney. Unfortunately there was no recording made of that version.<br/></p>

	<p class="title">signs (1989 - excerpt)</p>
	
	<p>An excerpt of a radio piece commissioned for The Listening Room on ABC FM. The work threaded together several spoken passages taken from Virginia Woolf (The Waves &amp; Mrs Dalloway)- the music presenting an evocation of imaginary landscapes that I attempted to grow out of clues in the texts. This is one such interlude.</p>

	<p>I was doing research into Musique Concrete at this time  and this segment is almost didactic in the way a snippet of locally-recorded birdsong is repeated in different treatments &amp; guises. In this case it's simply one way to treatment an audio fragment: preserving it's identity as a kind of 'phrase' but as if turning it over in one's hands to examine it from different angles.</p>
